This is my blog.

I'm Bryce - currently, I'm a site reliability engineer at [Gusto](https://gusto.com/). Outside of work, I'm a huge transit nerd, I watch (probably too much) TV (with a particular bias towards animation and science fiction), sometimes I play video games like Team Fortress 2 and Titanfall 2, and I probably spend too much time thinking about tech outside of work.

You can find out about me at [my website](https://brycetsuyuki.com) if you want.
